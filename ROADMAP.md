# Voxply Roadmap

Tracks **what's next, what's broken, and what we'd like to build but
haven't designed yet**. Everything else — architecture, design rationale,
shipped features, design questions — lives in the wiki at
[`docs/`](docs/README.md).

## 🔨 Next up

_(nothing — all pre-launch blockers are resolved)_

## 🚧 Blocked

- **Demo hub** — code is ready (`DEMO_HUB_URL` constant + conditional button). Blocked on ops: a Voxply-operated hub instance needs to be deployed and the constant flipped to its URL before the "Try a demo hub" button goes live.

## 📌 Wishlist (undesigned)

Things we want to build but haven't committed to a design yet. Designed
items live in the wiki — see
[`future-features.md`](docs/future-features.md),
[`gaming.md`](docs/gaming.md).

- **E2E group DMs** — Signal-style sender-key scheme (v2 of e2e-encryption.md); blocks until 1:1 E2E is proven stable
- **Windows Authenticode code signing** — needs certificate procurement; unblocks SmartScreen warning permanently
- **Missions system** — self-funding via sponsor-attested cosmetic actions; needs operator and anti-fraud design (see monetization.md)
- **Gaming Tier 3** — MMO + proximity voice; stretch goal

## 🧭 Designed, not started

_(nothing)_

## ⚠️ Known issues

- **Group DMs are plaintext** — hub operator can read group DM content; 1:1 DMs are E2E encrypted. Warning shown before entering group DMs. E2E group DMs (sender-key scheme) are in the wishlist.
- **Windows installer unsigned** — users see SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" warning; workaround documented in CHANGELOG.md (`More info → Run anyway`). Permanent fix requires Authenticode cert procurement (see Wishlist).

## 💤 Won't do

- **Load-aware DM routing across a user's hubs** — failover only; load-balancing needs gossip + cross-hub consistency. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md)
- **Concurrent mic test while in voice** — two cpal input streams unreliable cross-platform; live meter covers it
