# Voxply Roadmap

Tracks **what's next, what's broken, and what we'd like to build but
haven't designed yet**. Everything else — architecture, design rationale,
shipped features, design questions — lives in the wiki at
[`docs/`](docs/README.md).

## 🔨 Next up

- **Farm Phase 1 — client integration** — hub now accepts farm tokens and
  advertises `farm_url` in `GET /info`; clients need to branch on `farm_url` and
  route `/auth/*` calls to the farm. Follow-up: desktop Tauri command for
  farm auth flow.
- **Android component interaction dispatch** — component buttons on Android are
  render-only; need a platform HTTP/WS command wired up once the hub interaction
  endpoint stabilises.

## 🚧 Blocked

_(nothing blocked)_

## 📌 Wishlist (undesigned)

Things we want to build but haven't committed to a design yet. Designed
items live in the wiki — see
[`future-features.md`](docs/future-features.md),
[`farm-model.md`](docs/farm-model.md),
[`gaming.md`](docs/gaming.md).

- **Performance ceiling** — load test WS broadcast, search, voice relay
- **Accessibility + i18n** — keyboard nav audit, screen-reader, localization

## 🧭 Designed, not started

- **Farm Phase 2 (hub multi-tenancy) + Phase 3 (admin panel)** — detailed
  design in [`farm-impl.md`](docs/farm-impl.md). Proxy layer, `hubs` table,
  `POST /farm/hubs` with per-creator quota, admin settings surface.

## ⚠️ Known issues

_(none currently)_

## 💤 Won't do

- **Load-aware DM routing across a user's hubs** — failover only; load-balancing needs gossip + cross-hub consistency. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md)
- **Concurrent mic test while in voice** — two cpal input streams unreliable cross-platform; live meter covers it
