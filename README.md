# Voxply

A decentralized platform where players can hang out, talk, and play
together. Voice chat, text messaging, federated alliances of hubs, and
community-built games — all keypair-based identity, no central servers.

## Built with AI assistance

This project was built with substantial help from
[Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI assistant). The product
owner directs architecture, features, and tradeoffs; Claude drafts
most of the code, tests, and documentation, which is then reviewed,
adjusted, and accepted.

Calling this out for transparency — it's not a fully hand-written
codebase, and pretending otherwise wouldn't be honest.
